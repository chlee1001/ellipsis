# Ellipsis

Ellipsis hides selected menu bar items on macOS 27. Click its icon to show them. Click again, or wait, to hide them again.

## Requirements

- macOS 27.0 or later.
- Ellipsis must run from `/Applications`. `MenuBarAgent` matches the allow-list against apps in that folder only. A copy in any other folder hides its own icon.
- No permission is necessary. Ellipsis offers the Accessibility permission once, as an option. See Limits.

## Install a release

1. Download `Ellipsis-X.Y.Z.zip` from [GitHub Releases](../../releases).
2. Open the zip. Move `Ellipsis.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Open Ellipsis. The `…` icon appears in the menu bar.
4. Right-click the icon. Select "Settings…". Put apps in the hidden set. Or, with the Accessibility permission, turn on "Hide apps left of the Ellipsis icon" and Cmd-drag items to the left of the icon.

On a MacBook with a notch, a shown set may not fit in the menu bar. macOS then collapses the items that do not fit behind a `«` button, the Ellipsis icon first. So on a notch display, Ellipsis shows the hidden apps in a bar below the menu bar instead, one app icon per app, and the menu bar stays as it is. A click on an app in the bar opens its menu bar item. Settings › General › "Show hidden items" switches between the bar and the menu bar on any display.

Ellipsis checks GitHub Releases for updates with [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org). At the second launch, it asks whether it can check on its own. "Check for Updates…" in the icon menu checks now.

## Limits

- Private API. Ellipsis loads `MenuBarClientCore.framework` and uses its `MBAssessmentMode` classes. A macOS update can rename or remove them. Ellipsis checks for the classes at launch and shows an alert if they are missing.
- Focus and the camera/microphone indicator are hidden while any set is hidden. No setting brings them back. This is a limit of the API.
- The hidden sets hold whole apps, not single items. An app with two menu bar items hides both.
- The bar below the menu bar shows app icons, not the items. An item that changes (a timer, a meter) shows only its app icon there. A click on an app in the bar pins its item in the menu bar for you to click, up to three at once; without the Accessibility permission the other items give way while a pin is up.
- The app pickers in Settings list every running app, not only apps with a menu bar item. With the Accessibility permission, they list only apps with a menu bar item, the icon can work as a divider (Cmd-drag items to its left to hide them), and the clock zone fits the clock. The permission is optional. Ellipsis asks once at first launch, and again only from Settings.
